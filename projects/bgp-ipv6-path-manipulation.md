# 🌐 BGP IPv6 Path Manipulation Lab

## 📌 Overview
Configured IPv6 BGP routing and manipulated inbound and outbound path selection using various BGP policy tools.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Establish IPv6 BGP peering  
- Control outbound routing using local preference  
- Influence inbound routing via AS-path prepend  
- Use prefix-lists to filter traffic  

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Cisco IOS  
- BGP IPv6  
- Prefix-lists  
- Route-maps  
- Local preference  
- AS-path prepend  

## ⭐ Highlights
- Achieved full control of routing direction  
- Applied dual policy (inbound & outbound)  
- Improved routing stability through refined prefix filtering
