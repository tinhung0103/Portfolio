# 🛰 Multi-Area OSPF & EIGRP Lab

## 📌 Overview
Designed an enterprise routing environment using multi-area OSPF and EIGRP, including redistribution, prefix filtering, and timer optimization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build multi-area OSPF hierarchy  
- Connect EIGRP and OSPF domains with redistribution  
- Implement prefix-lists for routing control  
- Improve convergence by tuning routing timers  

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Cisco IOS  
- OSPF multi-area  
- EIGRP  
- Prefix-lists  
- Route filtering  
- Timer tuning  

## ⭐ Highlights
- Implemented stable redistribution strategy  
- Reduced convergence time using optimized timers  
- Increased routing security using passive interfaces  
- Prevented loops with prefix-based filtering
